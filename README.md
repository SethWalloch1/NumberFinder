# NumberFinder

This is a simple Java program that uses Binary search to find a certain number from a list. Since I am using Binary Search this code runs in O(log n) time and also prints the amount of comparisons it took to find the number if the number was actually in the list.

Sample Input: findMe 11 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13                                                                                                   
Note: The number we are looking for is "11" or the first number given before the list.

Sample Output:                                                                                                                           
11's index in the list is: 9                                                                                                                     
The amount of comparisons done: 3
